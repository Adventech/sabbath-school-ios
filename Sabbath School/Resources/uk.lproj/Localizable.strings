Тому ми прагнемо забезпечити високу якість усіх наших проектів абсолютно безкоштовно за допомогою любові та відданості. Ми прагнемо віддати славу нашого Батька, бо Він гідний найвищих похвал.\n\nМи дійсно віримо в те, що Бог підвищив знання сучасного світу і хоче, щоб ми використовували його для Його слави, щоб проголосити Його швидке повернення!";
