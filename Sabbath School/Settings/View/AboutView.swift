The aim of the Sabbath School and Personal Ministries app is to combine many of these resources into one convenient location. As more resources continue to be added, church members and their families will soon be equipped with a wealth of resources to aid them in studying and sharing Godâ€™s Word.\n\nTo facilitate the maintenance and development of the app, the SSPM Department is glad to partner with the dedicated and talented team at Adventech.".localized())
